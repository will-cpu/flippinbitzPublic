Source for webapp Front/Back

For anyone who wants to check out the source code to the web app.



Backend directory contains all the code hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

The src directory contains all the frontend code, which sits in an S3 bucket.

The signup feature is disable, since I am not wanting anyone from the public to make an account.
 However, if you would like an account, please send and email to flippinbitz@gmail.com.
